Species: Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis)
5 hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: The article hypothesizes that conspecifics, heterospecific competitors and predators, with the most pronounced response being to calls of predators. We suggest that squirrels may view conspecific and corvid vocalizations as cues of potential conflict while foraging, necessitating increased vigilance. They use white noise as a control so that the squirrels aren’t reacting to every noise they hear. The independent variable are the sounds that the scientists used, the dependent variable was the squirrels reaction when they were foraging. My critique is that they Used the sounds intermittently instead of constantly and used iTunes for the sound. It may sound exaggerated to the squirrels or not as natural. They also used only one sound per each squirrel they encountered. To build off of the hypothesis I thought that Squirrels use sound cues during foraging as a way to determine if danger is nearby without losing focus or finding food. 
Hypothesis 2: The article hypothesizes that the squirrels’ alarm calling sequences are influenced by a more complex temporal sequencing of acoustic units. There was no control, the independent variable was the duration and pitch of the squirrel’s calls. The dependent variable were the perceived threats from the squirrels. Although I can understand why it is difficult to have a control since this is an observational study, the lack of having a control group can mislead the scientists to create the wrong conclusions since they have to deduce exactly the reason why the squirrels are making call noises. Our new hypothesis is Squirrels use a variety of noises and movements to warn other squirrels of a threat that is within the area.
