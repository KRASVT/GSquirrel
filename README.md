Species: Eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis)
5 hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: The article hypothesizes that conspecifics, heterospecific competitors and predators, with the most pronounced response being to calls of predators. We suggest that squirrels may view conspecific and corvid vocalizations as cues of potential conflict while foraging, necessitating increased vigilance. They use white noise as a control so that the squirrels aren’t reacting to every noise they hear. The independent variable are the sounds that the scientists used, the dependent variable was the squirrels reaction when they were foraging. My critique is that they Used the sounds intermittently instead of constantly and used iTunes for the sound. It may sound exaggerated to the squirrels or not as natural. They also used only one sound per each squirrel they encountered. To build off of the hypothesis I thought that Squirrels use sound cues during foraging as a way to determine if danger is nearby without losing focus or finding food. 
Hypothesis 2: The article hypothesizes that the squirrels’ alarm calling sequences are influenced by a more complex temporal sequencing of acoustic units. There was no control, the independent variable was the duration and pitch of the squirrel’s calls. The dependent variable were the perceived threats from the squirrels. Although I can understand why it is difficult to have a control since this is an observational study, the lack of having a control group can mislead the scientists to create the wrong conclusions since they have to deduce exactly the reason why the squirrels are making call noises. Our new hypothesis is Squirrels use a variety of noises and movements to warn other squirrels of a threat that is within the area.
Choosen Hypothesis Research Design: The hypothesis that our group selected is that Squirrels use sound cues during foraging as a way to determine if danger is nearby without losing focus or finding food. In order to enact this we decided that a Quasi Experimental study would make the most sense since the majority of our research would have to be observational based. There is not going to be a control group since we cannot gather the squirrels. It is also better to have the squirrels in their natural environment because the squirrels will react genuinely to any stimuli present in their world. The plan is that the recorder will slowly approach the squirrel and observe their reaction to the recorder. To avoid Practice effects we will use a different squirrel when observing. Some of the questions that will be asked when the recorder is observing would be: is the squirrel turned towards the recorder? Does it acknowledge the recorder? Does it seem defensive when approached? Is it running away from the recorder or is there another external force? Due to our style of research the study is prone to human error since it is an observational study. We must infer what the squirrel’s behavior means so the observer is prone to guessing incorrectly. There is also the possibility that other external factors could make the squirrel display behaviors that we previously did not observe.
